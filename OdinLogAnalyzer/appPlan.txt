Key Points
	• It seems likely that implementing a text analysis tool like TextAnalysisTool.NET in Odin with raylib and raygui is feasible, with word wrap as an added feature and cross-platform support due to Odin's and raylib's capabilities.
	• Research suggests splitting the implementation into phases, starting with basic UI, file handling, and text display, then adding advanced features like filters and find functions.
	• The evidence leans toward using Odin's standard library for file I/O and text processing, with raygui for the menu and raylib for rendering, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
File Reading and ChunkingFor file reading, start by loading small files into memory with os.read_entire_file and split into lines using strings.split. For large files, use core:bufio for chunked reading, reading lines on demand to manage memory, especially for virtual scrolling.Menu and Text Area RenderingSplit menu rendering (raygui buttons, toggles) from text area rendering (raylib text drawing) for modularity. Use separate procedures in the main loop, passing a shared State struct for data.Virtual ScrollingVirtual scrolling renders only visible lines based on scroll_offset, calculated from text area height and line height, using rl.BeginScissorMode for clipping and rl.GetMouseWheelMove for input.Word Wrap and Line NumbersImplement word wrap by splitting lines into words and rendering within text area width, using rl.MeasureText. Toggle line numbers via menu, showing them only for the first wrapped line of each logical line, with appropriate indentation.Cross-Platform ConsiderationsOdin and raylib ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS). Test on all platforms to ensure features work, leveraging Odin's and raylib's inherent support.

Comprehensive Plan for Implementing a Cross-Platform Text Analysis Tool in Odin Using raylib and rayguiThis document outlines a detailed plan for developing a cross-platform text analysis tool in Odin using raylib and raygui. The tool will replicate the functionality of TextAnalysisTool.NET (as described in the provided URLs) while adding word wrap and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. The plan is designed for a junior developer and includes clear steps, implementation details, and considerations for each feature. It is structured to be shared with a project manager (PM) for task breakdown and progress tracking, as of 11:47 PM WEST on Friday, August 1, 2025.

		○ Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Implementation PlanPhase 1: Setup and Basic UI
	• Task 1.1: Project Setup
		○ Create a new Odin project.
		○ Import raylib and raygui from Odin's vendor directory.
		○ Initialize raylib window (e.g., rl.InitWindow(800, 600, "Text Analysis Tool")).
		○ Set up the main loop with rl.BeginDrawing, rl.ClearBackground, and rl.EndDrawing.
	• Task 1.2: UI Layout
		○ Create a menu bar using raygui with buttons:
			§ "Open" (initially loads a hardcoded file like "example.txt").
			§ "Save" (saves current text to file).
			§ "Find" (opens a find dialog).
			§ Toggles for "Word Wrap" and "Show Line Numbers".
		○ Define a large rectangle for the text area (e.g., rl.Rectangle{10, 50, 780, 500}).
	• Task 1.3: State Management
		○ Define a State struct to hold application data:
odin

State :: struct {
    logical_lines: [dynamic]string,
    display_lines: [dynamic]DisplayLine,
    scroll_offset: f32,
    word_wrap: bool,
    show_line_numbers: bool,
    needs_redraw_display_lines: bool,
    // Add more as needed (e.g., filters, find history)
}
DisplayLine :: struct {
    logical_line_index: int,
    is_first_of_logical: bool,
    text: string,
}
Phase 2: File Handling and Text Display
	• Task 2.1: File Reading
		○ Implement load_file to read a file into memory:
			§ Use os.read_entire_file for small files.
			§ Split into logical lines using strings.split(file_content, '\n').
			§ Store in state.logical_lines.
		○ For large files, consider chunked reading with core:bufio later.
		○ Research suggests using core:bufio for efficiency, reading lines on demand with procedures like bufio.reader_read_string.
	• Task 2.2: Word Wrap and Display Lines
		○ Implement generate_display_lines:
			§ If word_wrap is true, split each logical line into wrapped lines using a word wrap function.
			§ If word_wrap is false, use logical lines as display lines.
			§ Each display line includes logical_line_index and is_first_of_logical for line number rendering.
		○ Example:
odin

generate_display_lines :: proc(logical_lines: []string, max_width: f32, font_size: i32, word_wrap: bool) -> [dynamic]DisplayLine {
    display_lines := make([dynamic]DisplayLine)
    for i, line in logical_lines {
        if !word_wrap {
            append(&display_lines, DisplayLine{logical_line_index = i, is_first_of_logical = true, text = line})
        } else {
            wrapped := generate_wrapped_for_line(line, max_width, font_size)
            for j, wrapped_text in wrapped {
                is_first := (j == 0)
                append(&display_lines, DisplayLine{logical_line_index = i, is_first_of_logical = is_first, text = wrapped_text})
            }
        }
    }
    return display_lines
}
generate_wrapped_for_line :: proc(line: string, max_width: f32, font_size: i32) -> [dynamic]string {
    wrapped := make([dynamic]string)
    words := strings.fields(line)
    current_line := ""
    for _, word in words {
        test_line := current_line
        if len(test_line) > 0 {
            test_line += " "
        }
        test_line += word
        if f32(rl.MeasureText(test_line, font_size)) > max_width {
            if len(current_line) > 0 {
                append(&wrapped, current_line)
                current_line = word
            } else {
                append(&wrapped, word)
                current_line = ""
            }
        } else {
            if len(current_line) > 0 {
                current_line += " " + word
            } else {
                current_line = word
            }
        }
    }
    if len(current_line) > 0 {
        append(&wrapped, current_line)
    }
    return wrapped
}
	• Task 2.3: Text Rendering
		○ Implement render_text_area:
			§ Calculate visible lines based on scroll_offset and text area height.
			§ For each visible display_line:
				□ If show_line_numbers and is_first_of_logical, draw the line number at text_area.x.
				□ Draw the text at text_start_x (adjusted for line numbers).
			§ Use rl.BeginScissorMode to clip rendering to the text area.
		○ Example:
odin

render_text_area :: proc(state: ^State, text_area: rl.Rectangle, font_size: i32) {
    line_height := f32(font_size)
    first_visible_line := int(state.scroll_offset / line_height)
    visible_lines := int(text_area.height / line_height) + 1
    end_line := min(first_visible_line + visible_lines, len(state.display_lines))

text_start_x := text_area.x
    if state.show_line_numbers {
        max_line_num_width := rl.MeasureText(fmt.tprintf("%d: ", len(state.logical_lines)), font_size)
        text_start_x = text_area.x + f32(max_line_num_width)
    }

rl.BeginScissorMode(i32(text_area.x), i32(text_area.y), i32(text_area.width), i32(text_area.height))
    defer rl.EndScissorMode()

for i := first_visible_line; i < end_line; i += 1 {
        display_line := state.display_lines[i]
        y := text_area.y + f32(i - first_visible_line) * line_height - (state.scroll_offset - f32(first_visible_line) * line_height)
        if state.show_line_numbers && display_line.is_first_of_logical {
            line_num_str := fmt.tprintf("%d: ", display_line.logical_line_index + 1)
            rl.DrawText(line_num_str, i32(text_area.x), i32(y), font_size, rl.GRAY)
        }
        rl.DrawText(display_line.text, i32(text_start_x), i32(y), font_size, rl.BLACK)
    }
}
	• Task 2.4: Scrolling
		○ Handle mouse wheel input with rl.GetMouseWheelMove.
		○ Update scroll_offset and clamp it to valid range.
		○ Example:
odin

wheel := rl.GetMouseWheelMove()
state.scroll_offset -= f32(wheel) * line_height
max_scroll := f32(len(state.display_lines)) * line_height - text_area.height
state.scroll_offset = max(0, min(state.scroll_offset, max_scroll))
Phase 3: Advanced Features
	• Task 3.1: Filters
		○ Define a Filter struct (e.g., type: include/exclude, pattern: string/regex).
		○ Implement filter application:
			§ Generate a filtered list of display lines based on user-defined filters.
			§ Allow saving and loading filter sets.
	• Task 3.2: Find Function
		○ Implement a find dialog (using raygui or custom UI).
		○ Search for literal strings or regex in logical lines.
		○ Highlight matches (e.g., by changing text color).
	• Task 3.3: Markers
		○ Allow users to mark lines (e.g., with different colors or symbols).
		○ Implement navigation between marked lines.
	• Task 3.4: Import/Export
		○ Add clipboard support (e.g., copy selected lines).
		○ Implement save functionality (write current text to file).
	• Task 3.5: File Dialog
		○ Integrate a file dialog library (e.g., tinyfiledialogs via C bindings).
		○ Alternatively, implement a simple file browser within the app.
Phase 4: Optimization and Polish
	• Task 4.1: Large File Handling
		○ Use core:bufio for chunked reading of large files.
		○ Implement virtual scrolling by loading only visible lines.
		○ Research suggests using bufio.Reader for efficiency, reading lines on demand with bufio.reader_read_string.
	• Task 4.2: Cross-Platform Testing
		○ Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
		○ Ensure all features work across platforms.
	• Task 4.3: UI Enhancements
		○ Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+F for find).
		○ Improve menu bar aesthetics with raygui styling.
	• Task 4.4: Documentation and Error Handling
		○ Add error handling for file operations.
		○ Document code for maintainability.
